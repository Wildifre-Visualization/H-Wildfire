Project Overview:
  - This project centers around the creation of an interactive visualization model of wildifires caused by lightning strikes.  The visualization is a heatmap generated by javscript using the mapping-platform 'Mapbox'.  Within the our heatmap, there are 3 accesible layers based on 5 year ranges; 2000-2005, 2005-2010, 2010-2015.  Our data was sourced from kaggle.com orignally as a csv file.  The csv was then shaped into geoJSON fromat using pandas.
