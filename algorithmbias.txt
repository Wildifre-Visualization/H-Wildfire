What did the algorithm do?
    - The algorithm used previous healthcare spending to flag patients in need of crucial care
What information did the algorithm use to make its predictions?
    - Previous healthcare spendinng
What information did the researchers use to determine that the algorithm was biased?
    - The higher percentage of chornic illness in black patients.  Likely due to lower trust levels in provided healthcare.

What was the impact of the algorithmic bias?
    - Black patients weren't flagged for critical healthcare needs as frequently as their white counterparts
What were the primary causes of the bias?
    - Lower trust in healthcare providers directly correlated with less spending, feeding a biased trend
How might you address the issues that the researchers found?
    - Rather than rely on income driven data, focus the intent of the data anylsis for the algorithm toward a specific set of precursor medical conditions.
